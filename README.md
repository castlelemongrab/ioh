This is a shared library that seeks to provide simple standard output,
standard error, and file I/O abstractions for different ES7 environments.
The library currently contains a browser implementation (`console`),
a Node implementation (`process`), and a string builder implementation.
This library is intended to be extremely minimalist, and is currently
only used internally. Seriously, please don't use this - yet, anyway.
